# Dating App Authentication UI

This Flutter app provides a simple and elegant way to authenticate users into a dating app. The app consists of three screens: login, signup, and welcome.

The login screen allows users to sign in with their email address and password. The signup screen allows users to create a new account by providing their email address, password, and other personal information. The welcome screen shows options for login or signup, so users can easily switch between the two.

The app uses a modern and minimalist design that is both easy to use and visually appealing.
